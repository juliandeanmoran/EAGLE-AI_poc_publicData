Paternally inherited missense variant identified through whole exome sequencing and validated by Sanger sequencing. The variant is detected in a gene in which non-synonymous variation is the known disease mechanism. The variant is located within one of the 4 transmembrane repeats that form the pore of the channel, which is a mutational hotspot. Although the variant is absent in gnomAD, a different amino-acid substitution is reported (p.S672W). On the other hand, the p.S672L missense variant is present on ClinVar, where it is classified as likely pathogenic. This variant has been detected in additional unrelated case with similar clinical phenotype characterized by neurodevelopmental phenotype, reported by Zhou X et al. (2022) Row: 8 and Hofer NT et al. (2020) Row: 34. Suggesting that the variant is pathogenic. The variant was scored under the criteria of predicted/proven null although it causes a gain of function effect, based on functional evidence that supports the pathogenicity of the variant. Hofer NT et al. (2020) PMID: 31921405 performed a series of experiments to investigate the effect of the variant. It was shown that the mutant protein induces an increase in calcium influx and hence, higher intracellular calcium levels. The missense variant changes the voltage-dependence activation and steady state-inactivation to more negative voltages, suggesting a gain-of-function effect. This is consitent with the main mechanism of the disease associated with the gene. The authors further investigated the non-synonymous variant (p.S672W), which has been detected in healthy individuals in gnomAD. Consistent with the disease mechanism of the gene, this missense variant has an opposite effect on channel activity, shifting the voltage-dependence activation and steady state inactivation to more positive voltages, indicating a loss of function effect. Furthemore, the variant co-segregated with the phenotype in the family. Based on all this evidence, the p.S672L is clearly pathogenic.

Homozygous missense variant inherited from both parents identified through whole exome sequencing. Both parents are heterozygous for the variant. The variant affects a highly conserved glutamine residue which is also conserved in all genes from the calcium channel family. The glutamine residue is located in the extracellular region that connects the transmembrane helices S1-S2 of the second domain. Functional experiments performed by the authors of this study showed that the variant is pathogenic and alters the function of the channel. The variant affects the availability of the channel at the cell surface by impairing protein trafficking, resulting in reduced current densities. On the other hand, the variant also exerts a gain of function effect on the channel activity. The non-synonymous variant impairs the inactivation kinetics resulting in prolonged Calcium currents. This is consistent with the disease mechanism associated with the gene. For this reason, the variant was interpreted as pathogenic with default score 1.5. But no additional upgrades were applied.

Maternally inherited structural variant (SV) identified through clinical whole genome sequencing and further experimentally validated by orthogonal methods. The SV is a 50Mb pericentric inversion disrupting the DMD gene. The breakpoint of the short arm is located within intron 55 of DMD, thus, it is predicted to result in premature transcription termination and nonsense mediated decay. Experimental analysis confirmed that absence of dystrophin protein expression in muscle biopsy. Further supporting that the SV impairs the DMD gene. Although the inversion spans 50Mb containing many genes, the structural variant results in a balance rearrangement. Therefore, the involvement of additional genes is minimal but it cannot be rule out. Consequently, the SV was scored, assessed under the criteria of variant predicted/proven null, but a downgrade was applied (-0.5). No intragenic inversion are reported in gnomAD. On the other hand, the only clinically significant gene impaired by the SV is the POU3F4, a gene implicated in genetic hearing loss. However, the gene has not been associated with ASD risk.

Structural variant of unknown inheritance identified through targeted, long-read sequencing of a customized muscle-disease gene panel. Although the exact number of genes included in the panel was not specified, the score was not downgraded since the patient also underwent additional genome-wide molecular analysis. The structural variant resulted in a paracentric inversion due to microhomology between 2 transposons. This 216Kb inversion encompasses the promoters and the first coding exons of the cortical isoform (Dp427c), which is expressed in the brain, and the skeletal muscle isoform (Dp427m). Loss of expression of the dystrophin protein, in the skeletal muscle, was confirmed by experimental analysis. Confirming that the inversion leads to loss of function. Therefore, the variant is consistent with the disease mechanism of the gene, mediated by hemizygous loss of function. No intragenic inversion are reported in gnomAD. On the other hand, through the additional molecular testing, a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR region of the gene DIP2B was detected. This repeat expansion has been associated with autosomal dominant intellectual developmental disorder.

Since different deletions with distinct exon content can lead to different effects in the transcript, the variant was slightly downgraded (-0.25). The deletion was also inherited by the monozygotic twin brother. However, the sibling showed a remarkably different clinical profile, with normal development and no diagnosis of ASD, since he did not meet the criteria cut-off. Therefore, the variant is likely incompletely penetrant or additional genetic contributions could explain the difference in phenotypic expression. Furthermore, an additional clinically significant variant was also detected in both siblings, which was inherited from the unaffected father.

De novo missense variant identified by mutational screening of the coding sequences and adjacent splice sites of SHANK1 and validated by bi-directional sequencing. The score was downgraded since SHANK1 was the only gene investigated (-0.25). This missense variant affects a highly conserved residue located outside of the functional domains of the protein. The variant has been reported in gnomAD (-0.25). However, the score was upgraded on the basis of functional evidence that supports the pathogenicity of this missense substitution (+0.5). In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the pR874H variant is detrimental to SHANK1 function and induces ASD-like phenotypes in mice. In vitro analysis showed that expression of the missense variant in rat hippocampal neurons results in decreased size of dendritic spine length and width. Furthermore, a knockin mouse model showed that mutant mice carrying this variant displayed core ASD symptoms such as deficits in social novelty preference and presence of repetitive behaviors. Finally, mutant mice showed dysregulation of the mGluR1-IP3R1-calcium signaling pathway in specific brain regions, which may contribute to the ASD phenotypes observed.

No CNV deletions with 50% overlap in SHANK1 are reported in gnomAD, while deletions overlapping the entire coding sequence of CELC11A are observed in gnomAD. Although the CNV loss was detected by microarray analysis, additional whole exome sequencing allowed to identified only a nonsense variant in the gene PCDHGA11. This genes has not been associated with ASD risk nor with any disease phenotype. Furthermore, the gene is not intolerant to loss of function variation. Although PCDHGA11 encodes a neural cadherin-like cell adhesion protein involved in cell-cell connections in the brain, there is no robust evidence that supports that loss of function mutations in this gene contribute to the ASD phenotype. On the other hand, the CNV deletion containing SHANK1 co-segregates with the phenotype across multiple generations in this pedigree.

This is the first case with a double mutation detected in MeCP2, a nonsense and missense variant. Although the present case developed a more severe clinical phenotype, compared to other cases, who are carriers of the p.R294*, the phasing of the variants was not determined. Therefore, it is unknown if the variants are in trans. For that reason, the case was scored based on the variant with the more severe impact (i.e. nonsense mutation). The nonsense variant was detected by direct sequencing of the exons and exon-intron boundaries of the MeCP2 gene.

The non-synonymous substitution is absent in gnomAD, but it is reported as a pathogenic mutation by reputable databases such as OMIM and ClinVar. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of the missense mutation has been demonstrated by well-established in vitro and in vivo mouse models.

Likely de novo frameshift deletion variant identified by direct sequencing of the coding regions of the MECP2 gene. Mutational analysis of the variant suggest the variant is de novo but parental germline mosaicism cannot be ruled out. Given that the genotyping approach was restricted to MEPC2 gene and no genome-wide analysis was performed, the score was downgraded (-0.5). The variant is located near direct repeats ('ACCCC’ and ‘CCCCACC– – –CCTGAGCCC’), which explains why this is a mutational hotspot with several patients carrying similar deletions in this region. Since this variant creates a premature stop codon in a gene where loss-of-function mutations are a known disease mechanism, this variant is most likely null. In fact, it was shown that the C-terminal region is necessary for interactions of the MeCP2 protein with WW containing proteins. A protein truncated at position 400, was defective in protein binding. But the biological implications of this disruption is not completely known. On the other hand, the score was downgraded since several, similar frameshift variants have been reported in gnomAD in this region. Moreover, these truncating variants happen in the last exon of the gene and might escape the non-sense mediated mRNA decay.

The study investigated the level of MeCP2 expression in two brain regions (frontal cortex and fusiform gyrus, which are functionally relevant for autism etiology) from brain samples of autistic patients and other related neurodevelopmental disorders. Both at the transcript and protein level, the expression of MeCP2 was significantly and consistently reduced in brain samples from autistic patients, compared to age-matched controls. The decreased expression of the gene was correlated with increased methylation of the promoter region of the gene. Therefore, these results showed that abnormal epigentic control of MeCP2 expression might underlie the etiology of ASD, even in the absence of MeCP2 coding and regulatory mutations.",0-2,0.0,0.5
