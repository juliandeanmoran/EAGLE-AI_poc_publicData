The proband was born after an uneventful pregnancy and delivered at 38 weeks of gestation by cesarean section because of fetal distress. He failed the hearing test at birth and had seizures beginning at 4 months of age. At the age of 4 1 /2 years, he was reassessed at the genetic clinic for the purpose of family planning. He did not speak and his comprehension was limited. He exhibited autistic behaviors including very limited eye contact and hyperactivity. He wore hearing aids from the age of 11 months. At 5 years of age, he underwent hearing tests which revealed moderate hearing loss (40-50 db SPL across all frequencies from 500 Hz to 40 kHz). Whole-exome sequencing and filtering for homozygous variants revealed two potential candidate genes: A homozygous mutation in the otogelin gene (OTOG) ... and a homozygous missense variant in CACNA1D: Chr3 (GRCh37): g.53756476G > C; NM_000720.3: c.1701G > C (p.Gln567His). ... Both parents were heterozygous for the OTOG and CACNA1D variants. The high degree of consanguinity within the family was the basis for assuming a recessive model of inheritance. ... CACNA1D variants have also been associated with autism spectrum disorders (8) and epilepsy (8, 17, 18). Because of the coincident involvement of CACNA1D in the proband's symptoms (i.e. hearing loss, epilepsy, autism), we analyzed the functional consequences of the CACNA1D in a heterologous expression system.",
